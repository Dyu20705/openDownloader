# Changelog

## 1.1.0

- Added reviewed single-media acquisition plans, durable history, FIFO queueing, explicit retry, and interrupted-job recovery.
- Added private URL persistence, IPC error sanitization, cross-platform core checks, and Linux package startup validation.
- Bounded subprocess diagnostics, added recoverable session-only persistence fallback, and aligned tool events with shared application diagnostics.
- Reduced Tauri plugin permissions, removed remote font dependencies, and added separate TypeScript, ESLint, and release verification gates.
- Updated managed yt-dlp to upstream 2026.08.19 artifacts with pinned SHA-256 hashes.
- Pinned managed Windows MediaInfo CLI 26.05 to the verified official ZIP; removed unsupported managed macOS MediaInfo installation and retained custom/system executable support.
- Used the public Tauri runtime detection API and aligned PR/scheduled RustSec audits with strict release warning denial.
- Prevented release builds from discovering executables in the process working directory or repository tree; added regression coverage for yt-dlp and shared media-tool resolution.
- Validated and pinned destinations for in-process HTTP redirects, and documented the remaining yt-dlp network-boundary limitation.
- Required release packaging to pass quality and dependency-security gates on the exact tagged commit; hardened changelog extraction and Windows Authenticode verification.
- Known Linux limitation: the Tauri GTK3/WebKitGTK runtime includes glib 0.18.5, affected by the `VariantStrIter` unsoundness advisory RUSTSEC-2024-0429. Static inspection found no direct application use of the affected APIs, but does not prove complete unreachability. This residual risk and the build-time proc-macro-error advisory RUSTSEC-2024-0370 were re-evaluated on 2026-10-05 and explicitly accepted for v1.1.0 only; all other RustSec findings remain denied. Windows/macOS do not compile the Linux GTK runtime path. See [security disposition](docs/release-remediation.md).
