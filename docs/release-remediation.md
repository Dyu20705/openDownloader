# v1.0.0 final security disposition

> **Release-scope note (updated 2026-10-05):** this document preserves the original v1.0.0 disposition and records the explicit v1.1.0 re-evaluation. Production packaging remains Linux x86_64 only; Windows/macOS are unsigned CI portability targets. Exactly two RustSec exceptions are approved for v1.1.0 and no later version inherits them. See [packaging.md](packaging.md) for the active release contract.

The final engineering pass starts from `faee83087709800a5f71dbc84a41e4c4f9120edd` on `release/1.0.0-production-hardening`, confirmed against the fetched remote and PR #6. The owner explicitly accepted the two upstream advisory exceptions below for v1.0.0. Engineering validation is separate from final human acceptance, merge, tag creation, and signed release verification.

## v1.1.0 waiver re-evaluation — 2026-10-05

The owner explicitly approved carrying forward exactly `RUSTSEC-2024-0370` and `RUSTSEC-2024-0429` for v1.1.0 after re-evaluation. This is not a general waiver:

- `RUSTSEC-2024-0370` remains an informational unmaintained advisory with no patched version in the RustSec advisory database.
- `RUSTSEC-2024-0429` is fixed in `glib >=0.20.0`, but the current stable Tauri 2.12.1 Linux manifest still depends on GTK 0.18, which retains the affected GLib 0.18 line. A compatible stable Tauri bump therefore does not remove this dependency path.
- Core remains exception-free; the host ignores only these two IDs; every other cargo-audit warning/advisory remains denied.
- Any version after v1.1.0 returns to strict audit unless a new evidence-backed owner decision is recorded.

## RustSec disposition

PR/scheduled and release checks invoke the same repository-owned `scripts/ci/audit-rust.sh` with cargo-audit 0.22.2. It uses `set -euo pipefail`, retains `--deny warnings`, and leaves yanked-package checks enabled. Core has zero exceptions. Host ignores exactly RUSTSEC-2024-0370 and RUSTSEC-2024-0429; every other warning/advisory remains denied. No framework migration, vendored relabelling, lockfile hand-edit, or broad ignore is used.

**PASS for v1.1.0 with exactly two re-evaluated upstream advisory exceptions** is the accepted audit disposition. These exceptions do not mean the dependency graph is advisory-free.

### RUSTSEC-2024-0370 — proc-macro-error 1.0.4

This is an informational/unmaintained advisory with no patched version. The current inverse dependency tree leads through `tauri 2.11.5 → gtk 0.18.2 → gtk3-macros 0.18.2 → proc-macro-error`, and through `gtk → glib 0.18.5 → glib-macros 0.18.5 → proc-macro-error`. It is a transitive GTK/glib procedural-macro build-time dependency rather than application runtime functionality. Replacement requires upstream GTK/glib macro migration. Its maintenance risk was accepted for v1.0.0 and was explicitly re-accepted for v1.1.0 on 2026-10-05; it does not carry forward beyond v1.1.0.

### RUSTSEC-2024-0429 — glib 0.18.5

This is an actual unsoundness advisory affecting `VariantStrIter` iteration, with undefined behavior and possible optimized-build null dereferences. The Linux-only application runtime dependency comes through the Tauri GTK3/WebKitGTK stack: `tauri 2.11.5 → gtk 0.18.2 → glib`, and `tauri → tauri-runtime-wry 2.11.4 → wry 0.55.1 → webkit2gtk 2.0.2 → glib`. Windows/macOS do not compile the Linux GTK runtime path.

The upstream fix starts at glib 0.20.0. Inspection of the current official Cargo registry metadata and published manifest confirms the latest stable compatible Tauri 2.12.1 still requires GTK 0.18 and WebKitGTK 2; GTK 0.18 requires glib 0.18. A compatible stable Tauri upgrade therefore does not eliminate either accepted advisory. A direct glib 0.20 dependency would coexist with the affected version rather than replace it.

Application/static source inspection found no direct use of `VariantStrIter` or `array_iter_str` in the application core/host or the inspected Tauri, GTK, GDK, GIO, Tao, and Wry sources. This is risk reduction evidence, NOT proof of complete unreachability. The Linux runtime still includes the affected library. This residual risk was re-evaluated and explicitly accepted for v1.1.0 rather than introducing an unstable framework migration immediately before release. Any Linux smoke-test failure attributable to this GLib behavior invalidates the waiver and blocks release.

Any release after v1.1.0 must re-evaluate and remove these waivers if the upstream Tauri/GTK dependency graph permits it.

### Prior advisory remediation retained

Both lockfiles retain chacha20 0.10.2, replacing yanked 0.10.1 in the optional HTTP/3 graph. The compatible tauri-utils 2.10.1 / urlpattern 0.6.0 update removed the previous unic advisories RUSTSEC-2025-0081, RUSTSEC-2025-0075, RUSTSEC-2025-0080, RUSTSEC-2025-0100, and RUSTSEC-2025-0098. No additional advisory exception is accepted.

## Other security observations

The baseline's two CodeQL CSP findings point at substring-based Google Fonts exclusion checks. The preserved CSP commit replaces them with exact directive allowlists. Exact-candidate hosted CodeQL reanalysis is required; an older check result cannot validate the final candidate.

Production npm audit reports zero vulnerabilities. Full npm audit reports the moderate development-only `GHSA-82fw-gwwq-j7x9` in Vitest / @vitest/mocker 3.2.7. The workflow uses non-serving `vitest run`; these dependencies are absent from the production bundle. The published fix requires Vitest >=4.1.11, a separate major upgrade. No forced unrelated test-framework upgrade or audit suppression was applied.

MediaInfo hashes, official URLs, verified Windows layout, and reduced macOS managed support are recorded in [tool-management.md](tool-management.md). The Windows executable's version command has not been run on this Linux host.

## Local validation

Node 24.21.0 and Rust 1.96.0 match the workflow versions. Checks below record local validation for this final pass; exact-candidate hosted results must be reviewed separately.

| Tool-manager and URL security | PASS | Tampering, traversal, executable planting, cancellation, bounded output, private destinations and redirect regressions |
| Windows signing command contract | PASS | PowerShell 7.5.0 with mocked native signing and signature inspection; literal special-character paths and rejection on signing/verification failure, invalid status, signer mismatch, invalid thumbprint, missing file |
| Artifact, checksum, and GPG contracts | PASS | Actual workflow shell rejects zero/two artifacts and accepts one; preserves special-character paths; rejects tampered/missing files. Actual manifest signing/verification passes with an ephemeral test key and rejects a tampered manifest. |
| Linux package build and inspection | PASS | Debian `open-downloader` 1.0.0 amd64; `Name=openDownloader`, executable `opendownloader`, desktop entry and three icons; GTK3/WebKitGTK dependencies; no development files or extra executables |
| Linux package launch | PASS | Extracted Debian executable stays alive for 15 seconds under temporary Xvfb; software-display DRI3 warnings only |
| Naming | PASS | Zero obsolete-brand matches; lowercase matches are machine identifiers |
| Hosted CI, CodeQL, Windows/macOS | REQUIRED after the single push | Older SHA results are not final-candidate evidence |

Source and base-to-head history scans and the extracted Debian payload scan are clean. No new Gitleaks exclusion or allowlist was added. Local build output is not part of the source scan or release package.

Earlier remediation of the development-only helper cfg and Unix test-only constructor is retained. Strict release Clippy and the optimized production-resolution regression pass again. Release quality retains FFmpeg installation so real transformation tests run; FFmpeg, ffprobe, and yt-dlp are also available for local tests.

Historical v1.0.0 release semantics were reviewed under the earlier three-platform plan. The active release contract has since been narrowed to Linux x86_64 production distribution: exact tag/main/version validation, exact-SHA quality gates, Debian package inspection and launch smoke, provenance attestation, direct GPG package signature, GPG-signed checksum verification, exact release-note extraction, protected signing credentials, and tag-only publication. Windows/macOS production signing is deferred. The v1.1.0 carry-forward is explicit and does not automatically apply to any later version.
